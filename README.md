The Things Network is a global open crowdsourced Internet of Things data network.

## Getting Started With The Things Network

When you get started with The Things Network, you'll probably have some questions. Here are some things you can do to find the answer to them:

- Check out our [website](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)
- Read the [official documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/)
- Register on the [forum](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/) and search around
- Join [Slack](https://slack.thethingsnetwork.org) and ask us what you want to know
- Read background information on the [wiki](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/)

## Prepare your Development Environment

1. Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org) installed (version 1.7 or later).
2. Set up your [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)
3. Install the [protobuf compiler (`protoc`)](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases)
4. Make sure you have [Redis](http://redis.io/download) or [Redis from NuGet for Windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Redis-64/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) **installed** and **running**.  
  On a fresh installation you might need to install the [MQTT plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/mqtt.html).  
  If you're on Linux, you probably know how to do that. On a Mac, just run `brew bundle`. The Windows installer will setup and start RabbitMQ as a service. Use the `RabbitMQ Command Prompt (sbin dir)` to run commands, i.e. to enable plugins.
5. Declare a RabbitMQ exchange `ttn.handler` of type `topic`. Using [the management plugin](http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html), declare the exchange in the web interface `http://server-name:15672` or using the management cli, run `rabbitmqadmin declare exchange name=ttn.handler type=topic auto_delete=false durable=true`

## Set up The Things Network's backend for Development

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone --branch v2-preview --recursive https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/ttn.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/TheThingsNetwork/ttn`
3. `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TheThingsNetwork/ttn`
4. Install the dependencies for development: `make dev-deps`
5. Run the tests: `make test`
6. Run `make build` to build both `ttn` and `ttnctl` from source. 
7. Run `make dev` to install the go binaries into `$GOPATH/bin/`
    * Optionally on Linux or Mac you can use `make link` to link them to `$GOPATH/bin/` (In order to run the commands, you should have `export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"` in your profile).
8. Configure your `ttnctl` with the settings in `.env/ttnctl.yml.dev-example` by copying that file to `~/.ttnctl.yml`.

You can check your `ttnctl` configuration by running `ttnctl config`. It should look like this:

```
  INFO Using config:

         config file: /home/your-user/.ttnctl.yml
            data dir: /home/your-user/.ttnctl

         auth-server: https://preview.account.thethingsnetwork.org
   discovery-address: localhost:1900
           router-id: dev
          handler-id: dev
        mqtt-address: localhost:1883
```

**NOTE:** From now on you should run all commands from the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/TheThingsNetwork/ttn` directory.

## Run The Things Network's backend locally

- Set up the backend as described [above](#set-up-the-things-networks-backend-for-development).
- Run `forego start` to start all backend services at the same time. Make sure that Redis and RabbitMQ **are running** on your machine.
- First time only (or when Redis is flushed):
  * Run `ttn broker register-prefix 00000000/0 --config ./.env/broker/dev.yml`
  * Restart the backend services

## Build and run The Things Network's backend in Docker

- Set up the backend as described [above](#set-up-the-things-networks-backend-for-development).
- Add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:
    `127.0.0.1 router handler`
- Run `make docker` to build the docker image
- Run `docker-compose up` to start all backend services in Docker. Make sure that Redis and RabbitMQ **are not running** on your local machine, because they will be started by `docker-compose`.
- First time only (or when Redis is flushed):
  * Run `docker-compose run broker broker register-prefix 00000000/0 --config ./.env/broker/dev.yml`
  * Restart the backend services
